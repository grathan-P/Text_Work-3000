#About Text_Work-3000
Text_Work-3000 is a single-page text utility built with React 18 (CRA) that lets you quickly transform and inspect text (uppercase/lowercase, clear, copy, trim extra spaces) with live stats and previews.

##Core Features of Text_Work-3000
> Transformations: uppercase, lowercase, clear, copy-to-clipboard, remove extra spaces.
> Live analytics: word/character counts and estimated reading time; inline preview of the current text state.
> Theming: light/dark mode toggle with preference persisted to localStorage and page background updates
> Routing: HashRouter with Home (text tools) and About pages; navbar links with active states.
> Alerts: transient status messages for actions and theme switches.

##Tech Stack
> React 18 single-page app bootstrapped with CRA (react-scripts 5).
> Client-side routing with react-router-dom v7 using hash-based routes.
> UI built around a text toolkit (transformations + analytics) with light/dark theming.
> Test setup includes React Testing Library packages and jest-dom matchers.
> Build outputs are static assets from npm run build, ready for any static host.

##Primary Component
> App shell, routing, theme + alert state in App.js.
> Navbar with theme switch and navigation in Navbar.js.
> Text toolkit UI/logic in Textform.js.
> About page content in About.js

# Getting Started with Create React App
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts
In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
